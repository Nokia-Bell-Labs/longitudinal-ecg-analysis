Datasets
========

The package integrates with two publicly available datasets containing ECG signals and health outcomes: the  :ref:`\MUSIC Dataset <music-dataset>`, and the :ref:`\MC-MED Dataset <mc-med-dataset>`. :ref:`\MC-MED Dataset <mc-med-dataset>`.

In addition, bespoke datasets can be analysed by creating a bespoke `dataset_curator` script.
