# Longitudinal ECG Analysis: Predicting Health Outcomes from Wearable Data

The **Longitudinal ECG Analysis** toolbox is designed to investigate associations between ECG features and future health outcomes. It provides a processing pipeline to curate longitudinal ECG datasets (_e.g._ Holter ECG datasets), extract features from ECG signals, and then perform statistical analyses to identify significant associations between ECG features and health outcomes.

The documentation is available [here](https://nokia-bell-labs.github.io/longitudinal-ecg-analysis/).
